Fandom Guess is an offline app-game for groups of two or more people.

The main goal of the game is to get your team (or partner if playing in pairs) to guess a specific fandom-related word or phrase without using a list of forbidden terms provided on the card. The team earns points for each correctly guessed word.

Players need to be resourceful and eloquent to bypass the listed restrictions. The game requires quick thinking, creativity, and a good knowledge of the fandom, making it incredibly engaging and fun for all participants.
